				# username constraint = only can be numbers (for example)

print(number)			# ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'asdflkasjdf'
				# thus not able to convert our input into a number
				# so here we use a try except block
				# b/c if user types something invalid, then we want user to type something else
				# dont want program to crash like it just did

				# so add try: and indent next two lines
