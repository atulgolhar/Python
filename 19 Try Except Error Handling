				# username constraint = only can be numbers (for example)
text = input('Username: ')	# want to validate the username, could use if elseif nest statements but gets messy
				
number = int(text)		# create new variable number, and we want to int the text, and print to screen


text = input('Username: ')	# so far we have, run this f5, gives error
number = int(text)
print(number)			# ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'asdflkasjdf'
				# thus not able to convert our input into a number
				# so here we use a try except block
				# b/c if user types something invalid, then we want user to type something else
				# dont want program to crash like it just did

				# so add try: and indent next two lines
text = input('Username: ')
try: 				# so we try this block of code
    number = int(text)		# so we try this block of code, ingest text, turn into integer
    print(number)		# so we try this block of code, print text
except:				# if error this runs		(note could do this in advanced way accepting SPECIFIC type of error)

# better version

try:
