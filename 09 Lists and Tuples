lists are their own data type
data types are: strings, integers, booleans, floats, and today we explore lists

fruits = []			# note square brackets
				# lists are a collection of data types
				# can be same data type or different data types
				# everything seperated by a comma is known as an item

# we can see two different data types here
fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 3]

print(fruits)			# ['apples', 'pear', 'strawberrys']

# to see the indicie of that item
# everything is assigned an indicie, starting with 0

print(fruits[0])			# apple

print(fruits[1])			# pear

print(fruits[2])			# 3



# to add item to a list

fruits.append('strawberry')


fruits = ['apple', 'pear']
print(fruits)				 # ['apple', 'pear']
fruits.append('strawberry')
fruits.append('blueberry')
print(fruits)				 # ['apple', 'pear', 'strawberry', 'blueberry']

# note another way to do using slice operator and insert (will discuss this in later tutorial)

# to change the list


Tuple
# used for coordinates, colors, rectangles
# can use different data types

position = (2,3)

fruits = ['apple', 'pear']
position = (2,3)
color = (255,255,255)

print(type(fruits))			# <class, 'list'>
print(type(position))			# <class, 'tuple'>
print(type(color))			# <class, 'tuple'>
