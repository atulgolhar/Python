# ===============================================

# Longer notes view




# need to save text file in same directory folder as script
# path joining 

					# 1st way to do this
file = open('file.txt', 'r')			
f = file.readlines()			

print(f)				# to show you


['hello\n', 'atul\n', 'python\n', 'learning\n', 'easy\n', 'library\n', 'working\n', 'arrays\n', 'matrices']
	
					# note last word has \n missing
					# end of the line

NOTE: we removed last character (ie s) from that string 
matrices vs 'matrice']
so add if statement inside for loop

file = open('file.txt', 'r')
f = file.readlines()

newList = []    # create blank list
# need to iterate by item to remove \n
# use slice operator to remove \n
# remove \n using hammer
# then need to account for not removing last character
# remove \n using scapel
# but now last word (easy) is missing so now we need an else statement


file = open('file.txt', 'r')
f = file.readlines()

newList = []
for line in f:				# 2nd way
    newList.append(line.strip())	# 3rd way 

print(newList)

#for line in f:

#    else:
#        newList.append(line)

1 using open()
2 using open() and close() manually
3 using Pandas 
4 using NumPy


1 using open()

with open ('names.txt') as f:
    # Read contents of the file into a variable
    names = f.read()

    # Print the names
    print(names)


2 using open() and close() manually

f = open('names.txt')
# Read the contents of the file into a variable
names = f.read()
print(names)

# Dont forget to close the file again
f.close()


3 using Pandas (for large text files use Pandas library and DataFrame object that can read/manipulate text files)
# need to perform advanced operations on the data
# can work using .read_csv() .read_json() .read_html()


import pandas as pd

# Read a CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('example.csv')

# Read a JSON file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_json('example.json')

# Read a CSV html into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_html('example.html')

print(df)



4 using NumPy
# NumPy library is for working with arrays and matrices of numerical data.
# provides fuctionality for reading text files including loadtxt() and genfromtxt()

# numpy.loadtxt() allows parameters that specify how data is delimited, which rows columns to skip, how to handle missing data

import numpy as np

# Read a CSV file into a NumPy array
data = np.loadtxt('example.csv', delimiter=',')
print(data)
