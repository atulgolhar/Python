# .find(), .count()

# .find() is specific to python
# make variable called string and set it to whatever string we want

string = ''			# add text hello and assign that to variable called string
string = 'hello'		# we want to find the indicie of letter l
print(string.find('l'))		# 2 	# this is b/c the first l is found at the indicie of 2
string = 'hello'		# we have two l's in the string	 # if we change it to 'o'
print(string.find('o'))		# 4
				# note that this is indicie 4 of the string
				# h e l l o
				# 0 1 2 3 4  <-- indicies
				# this it the 4th indicie of that string  # this is the 4th index
print(string.find('7'))		# -1	# python does not find a 7 so it returns -1
				# use for checking if password contains forbidden character
# .count()			# counts how many of the characters
