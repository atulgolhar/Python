x = 2
y = 3
print(x == y)    # False

# lets start with the AND keyword

x = 2
y = 3
if x == y and x + y == 5:		# false and true 	yields false thus did not run
    print("ran")
else:
    print("did not run")

# did not run


# now change to != and run again	# true thus ran
x = 2
y = 3
if x != y and x + y == 5:
    print("ran")
else:
    print("did not run")


# now lets try the OR keyword
# now either condition can be true so either 1st condition or 2nd condition true then print ran will run
# thats b/c only 1 of the condition has to be true for it to run

x = 2
y = 3
if x == y or x + y == 5:
    print("ran")			# false or true 	yields true
else:
    print("did not run")


# can add as many conditions as you like
# so add/change code, save, then F5 to run

# now we add the not keyword

x = 2
y = 3
if not(x == y or x + y == 5):        # (false or true) yields true
    print("ran")                     # thus not () yields false
else:
    print("did not run")	     # did not run


Nested Statements

x = 2
y = 3					# x = 2, y = 3

x = 2
y = 4	now change this			# x = 2, y != 3


x = 4	now change this as well
y = 4					 x != 2


same code for all three input options
if x == 2:
    if y == 3:
        print('x = 2, y = 3')		
    else:
        print('x = 2, y != 3')
else:
    print('x != 2')
