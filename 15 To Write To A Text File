1st create file with text hello
need to close the file
write to the file


file = open'"file.txt', 'w')
file.close()


file = open('file.txt', 'w')

file.write('pythonista')

file.close()

# now open txt file and it contains only that word pythonista
# this removed the prior text by overwriting it
# 'w' will clear the entire file and writes new text
 



# run this
# everything is on the same line		pythonistaI am learning how to write to a file


file = open('file.txt', 'w')

file.write('pythonista')
file.write('I am learning how to write to a file')

file.close()


# write to a different line
# but want this to be on different lines
# need the escape character
# this tells Python to move to the next line

file.write('pythonista')		# old
file.write('pythonista\n')		# new

f5
no output to screen
so look at file.txt to see contents, now each line of text has 
its own line b/c we used escape character

pythonista
I am learning how to write to a file


# now we can insert \n into middle of the line to break it up
# see screen output to verify this occurs

file.write('I am learning how to write to a file')
file.write('I am learning how to \nwrite to a file')

pythonista
I am learning how to 
write to a file

# Next tutorial, we learn how to read and write to a new file
